These watches are set via a new method.  addPersistentWatch() and are removed via the existing watcher removal methods. Persistent.  recursive watches have these characteristics: a) Once set.  they do not auto-remove when triggered; b) they trigger for all event types (child.  data.  etc.) on the node they are registered for and any child znode recursively; c) they are efficiently implemented by using the existing watch internals. A new class PathIterator walks up the path parent-by-parent when checking if a watcher applies.\n\n\n Implementation Details\n\n- A new enum manages the different \"modes\" for watchers: `WatcherMode`.\n- For traditional.  \"standard\" watchers.  the code path is almost exactly the same. There is very little overhead other than a bit of extra checks in `WatchManager`\n- Given how this is implemented it was difficult to add support when `WatchManagerOptimized` is used. I'm open to adding it for that version but it will take work. We should consider not supporting persistent/recursive watchers when WatchManagerOptimized is used. I notice that `WatchManagerOptimized` is not even mentioned in the docs.\n- The mode for a given watcher/path pair is held in a map inside of `WatcherModeManager`. The absence of an entry means Standard. This way.  there's no overhead for old.  standard watchers.\n- `PathParentIterator` is the \"meat\" of the implementation. Rather than set watchers on every ZNode implied by a recursive watcher. WatchManager passes any paths it processes through PathParentIterator which iterates up each parent znode looking for watchers.\n- The remainder of the changes are scaffolding to match how other watchers are used as well as Jute/API changes to set persistent/recursive watchers\n\n\n Testing\n\nThe tests were written years ago. I think they're comprehensive but reviewers should pay attention to anything that was missed. There is much ZooKeeper knowledge that's only in the heads of ZK committers.\n\n- `PersistentWatcherTest` - tests persistent.  non-recursive watchers\n- `PersistentRecursiveWatcherTest` - tests persistent.  recursive watchers\n- `PathParentIteratorTest`- exercises edges of PathParentIterator\n\nAuthor: randgalt <jordan@jordanzimmerman.com>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@apache. org>.
